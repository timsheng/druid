# Note on Patches/Pull Requests

Fork the project
Test drive your feature addition or bug fix. Adding specs is importing so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
(if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
